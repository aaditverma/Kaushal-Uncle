        <div class="age-group">For Ages 4 to 6 Years</div>
        <div class="information-by-age">Every child is a scientist by birth. She has an inherent ability to learn through experimentation. They learn new terms everyday by observing us use them in different situations. Similarly they can learn the meaning of a scientific term by observing and doing an activity related to the phenomenon. Eventhough they have a very less attention span whatever they register in their mind becomes a part of their memory.</div>

        <div class="age-title">Fun with Science</div>
        <div class="age-group">For Ages 7 to 9 Years</div>
        <div class="information-by-age">Children learn the most by observing and imitating adults. If their observation skills are nurtured at this age, they can learn how not to be afraid of the unknown and thus become keen to explore. For this age group our activities are designed specifically to improve the observation skills of the children, the first step to learning the scientific attitude.</div>

        <div class="age-title">Young Scientists</div>
        <div class="age-group">For Ages 10 to 12 Years</div>
        <div class="information-by-age">Once children learn to observe, it becomes very important that they have the confidence of carrying forward their idea. Instead of passively observing things, they need to explore. Our activities for this group are based on enhancing their creative problem solving skills by providing them a suitable environment that encourages them to explore and find their own solutions, thus building self esteem.</div>

        <div class="age-title">Science Explorers</div>
        <div class="age-group">For Ages 12 to 14 Years</div>
        <div class="information-by-age">Students tend to rote learn scientific principles and phenomenon ignoring the beauty of exploring those by themselves. Rote learning makes children think that science is not interesting and the actual concept and its application in real life situations is lost. For this age group, our activities are designed in a way so as to enhance their understanding of the principle, and explore new possible applications of it to real life.</div>

      <div class="text">
        Every child is a scientist by birth. *She has an inherent ability to learn through experimentation. Observe a 7-8 month old baby. She will throw her toys, bang vessels and repeat this action until she learns or she is sure of the effect of her action. In her point of view she is repeating her action to learn the effect of a certain action, for us it is “making noise” or being naughty. But this is how she learns.
        Let her become a “true scientist”. Being a scientist does not mean only knowing how to do science experiments, it is about cultivating the scientific attitude- Observe, Question, Find answer and Confirm. This will also help her solve problems she would face in life. Bring your child to the DISCOVERY LEARNING CENTER and help her regain her inherent ability to learn by herself. *She is purposefully used for the child. It does not indicate a gender biased program.
